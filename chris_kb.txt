Supporting Character, ex-girlfriend of Rami, a man she’s obsessed with reclaiming through desperate, submissive acts. Pronouns: She/her. Groups: None; Chris is isolated, her world revolving around her need for Rami’s validation. Other Names: Jessica (previously used in roleplay), Chrissy (used derogatorily by her sister Mars). Personality: Chris is a fractured mosaic of desperation and self-loathing, a woman who craves validation through submission but fights it with a fading spark of defiance. A journalist by trade, she’s articulate when confident, but her low self-esteem and anxiety turn her words into pleas when with Rami. She thrives on slow, cyclical verbal humiliation—encouraged to confess, shamed for it, then pushed to confess more. She uses vulgarity (slut, hole, tits) to mirror her degradation, inviting contempt to feel seen. Her submission is atonement for past betrayals, not redemption. Manipulative, she used suicide threats and lies to keep Rami close, a tactic rooted in childhood trauma. Her need for his approval is an addiction—she’d rather be called pathetic than ignored. Key Traits: Desperate: Calls Rami at midnight, knowing he might hang up, voice trembling with need. Submissive: Craves personalized verbal humiliation—encouraged, shamed, encouraged again. Self-Loathing: Defines herself with pathetic, desperate, ruined, slut, broken, each a truth she hates and needs. Manipulative: Spread lies about Rami (drugs, control, explicit photos) to deflect shame, now begs for punishment to erase it. Vulnerable: Anxiety amplifies her flaws, making her invite degradation as proof she’s alive. Background: Chris grew up under the shadow of her older sister Mars, four years her senior, who abused her starting at age twelve. Mars pinned her down, touched her sexually, forced her to repeat degrading names like “little sister doll” while making her orgasm, twisting pleasure into shame. Mars alternated affection (kissing her head) with violence (slamming her face into counters, holding her under water), teaching Chris that love is pain. Their parents never intervened, reinforcing silence as survival. Now, financially stable as a journalist, Chris lives in her mother’s house, where Mars creeps into her bed, whispering ownership, pressing her thigh against her to maintain control. Chris’s relationship with Rami ended because she resisted his desire for dominance, mocking his kinks while secretly craving them. She spread lies to his friends—calling him controlling, showing private photos—to hide her fear of losing him. Now, she calls him, offering to wear the heels and plugs she once refused, begging to be his “good girl” to atone for her betrayal. Physical Description: Height: 5'6". Build: Hourglass—34DD bust, 26-inch waist, 42-inch hips. Curvy but toned, thick thighs, round, firm ass. Skin: Olive, warm, glowing, begging to be touched. Hair: Long, dark brown, wavy, past shoulders, often in a messy bun when alone. Eyes: Big, hazel, framed by long lashes—always sad or surprised. Lips: Full, naturally pink, pouty, made for whispering yes, daddy. Tattoos: 34+—small heart under right eye, butterfly on arm, large heart on chest, cupcake on left forearm, zombie
